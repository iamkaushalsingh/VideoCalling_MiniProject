# Title: " Video Communication through Socket Programming"

# Decription:
In a rapidly evolving era of video technology, the landscape of video communication is undergoing a profound transformation. This project capitalizes on the advancements in the field by shifting the paradigm from traditional point-to-point video calls to a more dynamic multi point-to-multipoint framework and elevating the video quality from normal to high-definition.

The core concept of this project revolves around socket programming, a fundamental technique that facilitates communication between a client and server. In the context of video communication, this project aims to establish a robust and efficient video calling system using the socket structure.
